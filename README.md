ProtocolLib
===========

A library designed to provide easy communication 
between a server and its clients over a user-defined
protocol. 
It allows for easy definition of packets in plain java.
Through the use of reflection packet-handling is as 
easy as defining a method in the handler-class, although
the use of listeners is also possible.
